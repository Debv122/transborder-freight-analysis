# TransBorderFreight Data Analysis Project
This project analyzes the North American TransBorder freight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). The goal is to uncover insights into freight movement patterns, identify operational inefficiencies, assess environmental impacts, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve the overall transportation system.

 Tools
 For this project, the following tools will be used:

 Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.

 Pandas: A powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It will be used for cleaning, transforming, and exploring the dataset.

 Matplotlib & Seaborn: Python libraries for data visualization. These will be used to create charts and graphs to illustrate trends and patterns in the data.

 Jupyter Notebook: An interactive development environment that allows for combining code, visualizations, and narrative text. It is ideal for data exploration and presenting the analysis step-by-step.

 Git & GitHub: Version control system to track changes and collaborate. All project files and progress will be managed on GitHub.
