# TransBorderFreight Data Analysis Project
This project analyzes the North American TransBorder freight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). The goal is to uncover insights into freight movement patterns, identify operational inefficiencies, assess environmental impacts, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve the overall transportation system.

 # CRISP-DM Stage 1: Business Understanding

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** North American TransBorder Freight Data Analysis  
**Data Source:** Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)  
**Timeline:** 2024  
**Stakeholders:** Transportation analysts, policy makers, logistics companies, environmental agencies

## Business Objectives

### Primary Objective
Analyze North American TransBorder freight data to uncover insights into freight movement patterns
identify operational inefficiencies, assess environmental impacts, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve the overall transportation system.

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Operational Efficiency**: Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in cross-border freight movement
2. **Economic Impact**: Understand trade patterns and economic relationships between US, Canada, and Mexico
3. **Environmental Assessment**: Evaluate environmental impacts of different transportation modes
4. **Policy Recommendations**: Provide insights for transportation policy improvements
5. **Predictive Analytics**: Develop models to forecast freight movement trends

## Business Problems and Analytical Questions

### 1. **Trade Flow Analysis**
**Question:** What are the dominant trade corridors and freight movement patterns between the US, Canada, and Mexico?
- **Sub-questions:**
  - Which US states have the highest import/export volumes with Canada and Mexico?
  - What are the seasonal patterns in trade flows?
  - Which commodities dominate cross-border trade?

### 2. **Transportation Mode Efficiency**
**Question:** How do different transportation modes (truck, rail, vessel, air, pipeline) compare in terms of efficiency, cost, and volume capacity?
- **Sub-questions:**
  - Which transportation mode handles the highest volume of freight?
  - What is the relationship between freight charges and transportation mode?
  - How does transportation mode choice vary by commodity type?

### 3. **Port and Border Crossing Performance**
**Question:** Which ports and border crossings are the most critical for North American trade, and how do they perform in terms of volume and efficiency?
- **Sub-questions:**
  - Which ports handle the highest value and volume of goods?
  - Are there capacity constraints at major border crossings?
  - How does performance vary by geographic region?

### 4. **Commodity-Specific Trade Patterns**
**Question:** What are the trade patterns for different commodity categories, and which commodities drive the most economic value?
- **Sub-questions:**
  - Which commodities have the highest trade values?
  - How do commodity trade patterns differ between Canada and Mexico?
  - What are the seasonal variations in commodity trade?

### 5. **Economic Impact Assessment**
**Question:** What is the economic impact of cross-border freight trade, and how has it evolved over time?
- **Sub-questions:**
  - What is the total trade value by country and year?
  - How do freight charges correlate with trade values?
  - Which trade relationships are most economically significant?

### 6. **Environmental Impact Analysis**
**Question:** What are the environmental implications of different transportation modes and trade routes?
- **Sub-questions:**
  - Which transportation modes are most environmentally efficient per unit of freight?
  - How do containerized vs. non-containerized shipments impact efficiency?
  - What are the carbon footprint implications of different trade routes?

### 7. **Operational Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies**
**Question:** Where are the major operational bottlenecks in the North American freight system, and what recommendations can improve efficiency?
- **Sub-questions:**
  - Which routes or modes show signs of capacity constraints?
  - Are there seasonal bottlenecks that need addressing?
  - How can technology and policy changes improve system efficiency?

 ###Tools
 For this project, the following tools will be used:

 Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.

 Pandas: A powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It will be used for cleaning, transforming, and exploring the dataset.

 Matplotlib & Seaborn: Python libraries for data visualization. These will be used to create charts and graphs to illustrate trends and patterns in the data.

 Jupyter Notebook: An interactive development environment that allows for combining code, visualizations, and narrative text. It is ideal for data exploration and presenting the analysis step-by-step.

 Git & GitHub: Version control system to track changes and collaborate. All project files and progress will be managed on GitHub.
